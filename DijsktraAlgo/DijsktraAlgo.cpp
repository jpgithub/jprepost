		Description First Dimension of the Array is Vertex, Second Dimenstion is Weights/Paths Length
		Index Association, each indexed element in the 1st dim will be represented as vertex.
		Each of the 1st dim indexed element will be have an assoicate 2nd dim (array) which will hold all the 
		weights associated with its neighbor vertex. A 0 will be use to indicate no association to this neighbor

		e.g take indexed element "0" it neighbors are 1 and 7 therefore the 2nd Dim (array) will be 
		{ 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0 }

		index 1 is mark with weight 4 and index 7 is mark with weight 8

		Thus "0" only has two neighbors vertex.
